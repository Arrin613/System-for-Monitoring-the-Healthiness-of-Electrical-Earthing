# System-for-Monitoring-the-Healthiness-of-Electrical-Earthing
This system integrates a variety of sensors with a microcontroller, such as a ESP32, to monitor key parameters, including earth resistance, soil moisture, connection continuity, and current and voltage levels. By employing soil moisture sensors, the system evaluates soil conductivity, a critical factor for effective earthing.
